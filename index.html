             movie 1: Scream VI 

             <br>
             Synopsis: Following the latest Ghostface killings, the four survivors leave Woodsboro behind and start a fresh chapter.
             <br>
             Starring: Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, and Courteney Cox.
             <br>
             reivews:"
Don’t be shocked if there are more laughs and whoops in the cinema than there are shrieks and gasps – but Scream has never tried to take itself too seriously which has always been part of the charm.", "
There just isn’t enough juice behind the stagecraft. The Scream movies have thrived because they’ve always stayed one step ahead of their source material -- but as the franchise grows more bloated, they risk becoming their own punch line."

<br><br>
movie 2: Creed III
<br>
synopsis:After dominating the boxing world, Adonis Creed has been thriving in both his career and family life. When a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy, Damian, resurfaces after serving a long sentence in prison, he is eager to prove that he deserves his shot in the ring. The face off between former friends is more than just a fight. To settle the score, Adonis must put his future on the line to battle Damian -- a fighter who has nothing to lose.
<br>
Starring: Michael B Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Jonathan Majors, and Woody Harris.
<br>
reivews:"While Creed III features a well-drawn, menacing adversary in Jonathan Majors’s Dame Anderson, it doesn’t utilize him enough.","
It's so predictable that you knew what was going to happen within the first few minutes. But this movie did hit the feels, particularly with the storyline with Adonis' daughter and Damian."

movie 3: John Wick: Chapter IV
<br>
synopsis:John Wick (Keanu Reeves) uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.
<br>
starring: Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgard, and Laurence Fishburne.
<br>
reivews: "
In John Wick: Chapter 4 — director Chad Stahelski’s brutal ballet of jaw-dropping action filmmaking and jaw-breaking stunts — overkill takes on a whole new meaning.", "
This might be the new crowning achievement of stunt-work and action imagery, but it's also a cautionary tale as to the pitfalls of excess."
